Version history for FileRunner.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3.0b1 - 2006-06-09

  - Deleted command line argument "-iconified" and fixed handling of
    directory c.l. args (thus fixed the "Clone" function).

  - Instead of an 'xterm', the command window button now opens a console;
    this is convenient to inspect the running FileRunner, too.

  _ Tweaked the user interface (with Mac OS X look and feel in mind).

  - The file listings are now in color; colors depending on file
    permissions.

  - Moved the status bar to the bottom (like is best practice).

  - Added 2 key bindings: Cmd-q for exit, Cmd-n for "Clone".

  - Built 'ext.c' for Mac OS X ('ext.dylib').

  - Got rid of "cross" botton in "QEdit" and "View" windows.

  - Fixed file sorting "on name" in "proc GetDirList".

  - The entries containing the paths show are right aligned now.

  - Added a main menu and deleted menu buttons accordingly.

  - Introduced button bar (with button groups).

  - Threw out "Show commands up/down" and "Toggle select" buttons.

  - Added "Edit" menu

  - More sophisticated platform check: "MacOSX", "Unix" or "Windows".

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.5.1 - 1999-12-30

  Fixes

  - Y2K bug fixed! :-) Year 2000 would show up as 100 instead of 00...

  - When you click in a text window and then pressed pageup/pagedown
    you would scroll two pages. Fixed.

  - Dialogs are now placed in the middle of the FileRunner window
    instead of in the middle of the screen (which was very annoying
    when running a Xinerama setup and the dialogs would pop up smack
    in the middle between the two displays...)

  - Executes 'wish' instead of 'wish8.0'

  - Sorry, did not have the opportunity to create Solaris binaries in
    this release. Will fix that in a week or so.

  I hope to make a more full featured release soon with some other
  stuff I want to get fixed/added but at least this release will get
  rid of that stupid Y2K bug (hopefully)...

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.5 - 1998-06-02

  News

  - Created new configuration browser, to ease browsing and editing
    the rather long list of options. Invoked with Configuration->Edit
    Configuration.

  - Automatically saves configuration (incl. hotlist) on
    exit. Configurable through config(save_conf_at_exit) in the
    configuration browser.

  - Mouse buttons used for wheel on wheelie-mice are now configurable
    through config(mwheel,neg) and config(mwheel,pos) in the
    configuration browser. These default to 4 and 5, respectively and
    corresponds nicely with the following kind of "Pointer" section in
    an Xfree 3.3.2 (or later) XF86Config file:

      Section "Pointer"
        Protocol        "Auto"
        Device          "/dev/mouse"
        # Choose button events for wheel up/down actions
        ZAxisMapping 4 5
        BaudRate        1200
        Resolution      100
      EndSection

  - FileRunner will now create relative links (as default) instead of
    absolute links when using the S-Link and S-LnAs
    buttons. Configurable via the config(create_relative_links)
    option. (A relative link is one that points to something of the
    form "../../foo". An absolute link looks like "/a/b/c/foo").
    Thanks to Norbert Erkeland for this code.

  - FileRunner now has the option of whether or not to run "pwd" after
    cd'ing to a new directory to check where it ended up. This is
    controlled by the variable config(cd_pwd) which is per default on
    (which mimics the behaviour of older FileRunner releases). If you
    set it to off, FileRunner will infer the new path from the old
    path. This makes a difference if you cd to a link that points to a
    directory. There is a similar config option config(ftp,cd_pwd) for
    the FTP case.

  - You can now colorize the middle command buttons in a supported
    way. Look at the config(middle_button_colors) in the configuration
    browser.

  - Added FTP resume background (async) download. See Utilities menu.

  - Added ForEach button that runs a command for each selected file.
    This command is very close to "Utilities->Run Command On Selected..."
    but instead of running one command on many files it runs one command
    per file.

  - Added "Etc->Recurse Command...". This runs a command recursively
    in the current directory and downwards using the Unix find utility.


  Fixes

  - ~/.fr/tmp is now used for temporary FTP files (primarily used when
    you "view" a file in an FTP directory). Using /tmp/USER_fr_tmp was
    a security risk, since anyone could create /tmp/USER_fr_tmp and
    put soft links in here that would get wiped when the user viewed a
    file by that name.

  - FileRunner no longer does a CD to the root directory when logging
    in to a remote FTP site.

  - Last downloaded filename through HTTP is saved for next download.


  Changes

  - FileRunner is now explicitly a part of the Open Source movement,
    as shown when choosing "File->About...".

  - "Settings" is now called "Configuration" consistently within 
    FileRunner. I've done a search/replace in the User Guide but
    I'm sure it's not perfect...

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.4.2 - 1998-02-15

  Fixes
  - Bug: "Error in startup script: can't read "glob(gui,color_cursor)": no such
    element in array"
  - Wrong date displayed in FTP listings sometimes.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.4.1 - 1998-01-04

  News
  - FileRunner is now distributed under the GNU General Public License.
    Let's hope it turns up in even more places. Redhat, are you listening? :-)
    (Btw: No one ever bothered to pay $20 for a commercial license, but I have 
    received a bunch of cool postcards. Keep 'em coming :-)
  - Support for "wheel"-mice. Scroll lists and text using the mouse wheel. 
    Thanks to Colas Nahaboo for this. Config parameter: config(mwheel,delta)
    determines how many lines to scroll for each wheel click. Shift-wheel
    scrolls one line.
  - You can now change the color of the cursor.

  Fixes
  - Fixed "checkowner" function when copying/deleting files.
  - Can now parse FTP site reactor.actlab.com (yucky WinNT host :-).
    Doesn't read dates from this site correctly, but who cares...
  - Various minor stuff.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.4 - 1997-09-07

  News
  - Supports Tcl/Tk 8.0 only. Get it! :-)
  - Added Batch FTP download. This is useful when you want to select a
    number of files for downloading when the files are not in the same
    directory or even on the same site. You can now browse any FTP site,
    add the selected files to the batch list, then later start the batch
    download and go do something else while the files download. See the 
    Etc menu.
  - HTTP downloading. This was just too easy to implement for me to be 
    able to resist :-) Just choose "Etc->HTTP Download" and enter an 
    URL to download. You don't have to bother with adding "http://"
    if you don't want to. Then choose a filename to save the download to. 
    You can also enter an HTTP proxy in the config(http,proxy) parameter.
    (Do a "Settings->Save Settings..." followed by a "Settings->Edit 
    Settings..." to see this parameter)
  - Added Help->Tips menu. This contains a few tips on usage, like how to 
    color your command buttons if you want to.
  - Foreground color for selection is now configurable.
  - User-configurable button commands now get an extra argument: The mouse
    button that was used to press the button. This means you can let your
    buttons do different things if pressed with different mouse buttons.
    Unfortunately this also means you need to add a new argument to the
    command. (Values: 1:Left 2:Right 3:Middle) See chapter 7 in the User's 
    Guide.
  - Added the following entry to the config(view,extensions) parameter:
      { {rpm -qilp {%s}}
        {*.rpm}
        -viewtext }
    This lets you view .rpm files. You'll have to put this in yourself 
    if you already have a config file.

  Fixes
  - FileRunner now handles file names with any characters allowed by the 
    file system. EXCEPTION: When copying directories the directory names 
    (source and destination) must not contain tick-marks "'" since this 
    is used as an escape character. I doubt this will be a problem in 
    the real world, though.
    FileRunner used to have a real problem with file names containing ", }, 
    ], $ etc. You don't want to know what a headache Tcl gave me with its 
    evaluation rules... AARGH!
  - "Show All Files" now also correctly shows file beginning with a dot . in the
    hyper-menu.
  - Miscellaneous fixes.

  Changes
  - Because of the new improved file name handling I've had to change the
    config(cmd,arc) command. This is now gone and replaced with
    config(cmd,archive). (The change was made only so I could enforce 
    a new default value for this variable, which I cannot if people already 
    have this variable in their .fr/config file.) The format for this command
    is now simply "archive-command {%s}" where {%s} will be substituted with
    the directory name at runtime. Do a Save Settings followed by Edit Settings
    and see the config file for more info on this.
  - The system wide config file is now called "config" and should be placed
    directly under the FileRunner installation directory.

  Stupid stunts
  - There are bits and pieces here and there in the code referring to WIN32...
    Well, I started to port FileRunner to Windows but I just got rather fed up 
    with it after having received a prolonged exposure to Windows programming...
    It shouldn't be too hard to finish, though.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.3 - 1997-03-30

  New stuff
  - FileRunner will now cache reads from FTP directories. (If you go to a 
    previously visited FTP directory, it will fetch it from the cache.) The 
    cache (all of it) will be invalidated when you press the refresh button (the 
    one with two arrows chasing each other). The number of directories 
    cached is configurable via the config(ftp,cache,maxentries) parameter. 
    I have a feeling this feature will come back and bite me... Tell me if 
    you see something fishy. :-)
  - Shows estimated time of arrival in both relative and absolute time.
    (I discovered relative time estimate wasn't very useful when it showed
    something like 1200 minutes...:-). Estimate is now calculated over the
    average transfer speed during the last two minutes.
  - New command line argument "-iconified" will start FileRunner in iconified
    mode.
  - Config files are now saved under ~/.fr/ (which is now a directory). The 
    .fr file is called .fr/config, the .fr_cmds file is called .fr/cmds and
    so on.

  Fixes
  - Couldn't handle files with the characters " { } in the file name. This
    fix unfortunately will have the effect of incorrectly sorting files with
    spaces in them last in the list.
  - If you run FR as root, having done "su" in a user shell, FilerRunner now 
    shows the correct "user@machine" in the top status line.
  - Doesn't barf anymore if it detects a socket or a pipe in an FTP listing.
  - I got a question on how to use the "-remote openFile()" argument to netscape
    if you wanted to have a default rule for viewing .html files. The answer was
    trickier than I though because of tclsh's hairy quotation and evaluation 
    rules. Anyway, here is how you do it: First, add the following to your
    config(view,extensions) variable:

      { {viewhtml {%s}}
        {*.html} }

    Then create a script called viewhtml that looks like this:

    #!/bin/csh -f
    netscape -remote openFile\("$argv"\)

    That should do it. The problem was that tclsh won't do the normal evaluation
    on lists inside ( ). That's why you have to do this work-around with the 
    external script.
  - Should now correctly work with Windows based ftp deamons. Thanks to 
    Colas Nahaboo for this fix.
  - Misc bugs fixed.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.2.1 - 1997-01-18

  Fixes
  - The "Find file" function now behaves better. It was stupid sometimes.
  - Now handles trouble converting FTP dates gracefully. If you have the
    timezone set to GMT+xx on your computer, there seems to be a bug in
    "clock scan" that prevents it from converting date strings with GMT+xx 
    in them. The result is that dates might be wrong. Work-around: Use
    another way of denoting the time zone, like MET or PST or whatever.
  - Select-all button didn't update the status line with selected/total...
  - A couple of other small bugs fixed.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.2 - 1997-01-14

  Features
  - "Find file" function added both for unix files and ftp sites. (Uses the
    "site exec locate" command to search FTP sites).
  - Added chmod button and GUI requester. Should be fairly intuitive.
  - Copy with resume for FTP added. Let's you continue an FTP transfer that
    was aborted. Great when Netscape drops an FTP download for no reason...
  - History is now saved to disk between invocations of FileRunner.
  - Shell commands are now always executed in the background. A small
    "R" to the right of the command line will turn red when one or more
    commands are executing. More than one command can be executed 
    simultaneously, output will be intermixed in the output window.

  Changes
  - FTP transfer speed measurement is now more correct.
  - New chapter on which files FileRunner uses added to the online guide. (10.2)
  - Minor smaller things mainly affecting the GUI.

  Bug fixes
  - Fixed: Mixes dates for ftp files (thinks some files are created 1997, when
    they were created late 1996).
  - Fixed: "Copy As" for directories: "can't read "destfile": no such variable"
  - Fixed: Error when copying FTP files that are links.
  - Fixed: Searching in the viewer or internal editor affected the selection.

  Notes
  - Don't run FileRunner 2.1.3 on Tcl/Tk 8.0a1. It's too buggy. Tcl/Tk that is.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.1.2 - 1996-12-08

  Features
  - Fully user-defined bindings for to the View, UnPack and UnArchive 
    operations. Re-generate the .fr settings file and see how they work.
    Warning: your old changes to the config(cmd,unarc,xx), config(cmd,unpack,xx)
    and config(cmd,arclist,xx) variables will not be used any more. See also 
    below on "New config default values".
  - You can now FTP to non-default ports. The format is 
      ftp://ftp.foo.com:8080/pub/bar
    Just leave the port stuff (:8080) out if you connect to port 21 
    (normal FTP).

  Bug fixes
  - Stupid "Can't find $USER variable" bug should be gone. FR will now look
    for the $LOGNAME variable if $USER cannot be found.
  - FR now correctly resets iconname after an aborted FTP transfer.
  - Matching on file name extensions are now case insensitive.
  - FTP file listings now a little more robust. (Couldn't handle wuarchive
    listings before).
  - Sometimes FR came up with incorrect left/right start directories.
  - Won't run the file panel updater if you're entering text in a text
    entry. (Since this will take the focus away from the entry widget
    and you don't notice you'll start typing keyboard shortcuts for 
    FR commands... Bad :-)

  New config default values:
  - You HAVE to fix your config(view,extensions) variable to reflect the new
    settings in this variable. For example, the rule for viewing .tar.gz 
    files is now in this variable. If you just want to get the default
    value for this variable into your .fr file, 1: edit the FR settings,
    2: delete the parameter and 3: save, then 4: exit. 5: restart FR, 6:
    save settings. Now the default value for this parameter will be in your 
    .fr file. If you're running FR for the first time you don't have to 
    bother with this.

      set config(view,extensions) {
        { {xmikmod {%s}}
          {*.mod.gz *.s3m *.mtm *.stm *.xm *.uni *.mod} }
        { {timidity {%s}}
          {*.midi.gz *.midi *.mid.gz *.mid} }
        { {xv -gamma 2.0 {%s}}
          { *.bmp *.iff *.jpg *.pbm *.pgm *.png *.ppm *.tga 
            *.tif *.tiff *.xbm *.xpm *.gif} }
        { {gzip -dc {%s} | ghostview -}
          { *.ps.gz } }
        { {ghostview {%s}}
          { *.ps } }
        { {xanim {%s}}
          {*.avi *.fli *.flc *.mpg} }
        { {gzip -cd {%s} | tar tvf -} 
          { *.tgz *.taz *.tar.z *.tar.gz }
          -viewtext }
        { {tar tvf {%s}}
          {*.tar}
          -viewtext }
        { {unzip -lv {%s}}
          {*.zip}
          -viewtext }
        { {lha -v {%s}}
          {*.lha}
          -viewtext }
        { {gzip -cd {%s}}
          {*.gz}
          -viewtext }
      }

  - The new parameter for unarchiving stuff.

      set config(cmd,unarc,extensions) {
        { {gzip -cd {%s} | tar xfBp -}
          {*.tgz *.taz *.tar.z *.tar.gz} }
        { {tar xfBp {%s}}
          {*.tar} }
        { {unzip -oqq {%s}}
          {*.zip} }
        { {lha -x {%s}}
          {*.lha} }
      }

  - The new parameter for unpacking stuff.
      
      set config(cmd,unpack,extensions) {
        { {gzip -d {%s}}
          {*.gz} }
      }



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.1.1 - 1996-11-03

  Small features/other
  - Changed to use Tcl/Tk 7.6/4.2. You can still run on 7.5/4.1 but 
    you'll have to edit the scripts.
  - Sort on reverse time added.
  - New platform support: AIX.
  - Support for system wide .fr file. (Sourced before the user's .fr file).
  - FTP sorting on time now implemented.
  - FTP: Selecting "show all files" now works.

  Bug fixes
  - Editing shell command color works.
  - Usage of "tar" internally now doesn't use the -B flag (for HPUX).
  - Using Tcl/Tk 7.6/4.2 seems to have fixed the infamous "grab failed" problem.
  - Misc fixes.

  Documentation
  - Added a FAQ file with know bugs and common Q's and A's.



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.1 - 1996-10-27

  Features
  - You can now copy both to and from an FTP site.
  - Recursive copying of directories both to and from an FTP site.
  - Makedir, Delete and Rename works in FTP. Recursive delete of FTP
    directories implemented too.
  - Rule based configuration of FTP site logins. For example always
    login with username X and password Y to sites matching *.Z.com using
    proxy P etc. See more in the online guide, chapter 8.8.
  - Icon name now shows estimated time of arrival (ETA) for FTP transfers.
  - Select All/Select None toggle button added to the lower right
    ofthe file list panes. This is the button with letter S on it.
  - If you enter a directory that doesn't exist you get the choice 
    of editing the faulty directory or create it. This is a convenient 
    way of creating new directories.
  - The middle mouse button in the file list now work the same way
    as mouse button 1 + ctrl. It doesn't deselect anything but just
    toggles the previous selection. Try it. See chapter 3.3.4.1
    for a list of available mouse operations.

  Smaller features/changes
  - When a new directory is created, all it's parent directories are created
    also if they don't already exist.
  - The escape button now works to exit the text viewer and editor.
  - The Page up/down, Home/End keys work in the text viewer and editor without
    first clicking in it.
  - Default colors are changed to a cool metallic green. Just change it if you
    don't like it...
  - The Abort button is called Stop now.

  Documentation
  - Reworked chapter 8 about FTP.
  - Reworked chapter 3.3.4.1 about mouse buttons in the file list. Here you
    can now find a list of mouse operations available.
  - Misc. changes.

  Bug fixes
  - User defined bindings from file extensions to action (e.g. .jpg -> 
    launch image viewer) are now searched before the built-in bindings.
  - FTP now correctly handles filenames with spaces in them,
  - Hopefully the infamous "grab failed: application already has grab" 
    will be a little less frequent. There is still a bug inside the Tk 
    menu code that can trigger this bug.
  - Move on FTP file crashed FR. (It can't move FTP files yet, but it 
    shouldn't crash...)
  - The recursive directory menu now correctly handles filenames with   
    spaces in them.
  - More misc. bug fixes.

  There are new default values for the some parameters. If you already 
  have a .fr file, you can see below what the new defauls are:
    set config(gui,color_select) "#f1a9ec43aa9d"
    set config(gui,color_scheme) "#d1f0dfbebd10"
    set config(view,extensions) {
        { {xmikmod {%s}}    { *.mod.gz *.s3m *.mtm *.stm *.xm *.uni *.mod } }
        { {timidity {%s}}   { *.midi.gz *.midi *.mid.gz *.mid } }
        { {xv -8 {%s}}      { *.bmp *.iff *.jpg *.pbm *.pgm *.png *.ppm 
          *.tga *.tif *.tiff *.xbm *.xpm *.gif } }
        { {gzip -dc {%s} | ghostview - } { *.ps.gz } }
        { {ghostview {%s}} { *.ps } }
      }
    set config(cmd,touch) "touch"
    set config(cmd,du) "du -s"

  Known bugs
  - There is still a problem with the grab failed thing that can pop up here 
    and there. It seems to be a problem in the Tk menu implementation.
    Anyone have any ideas how to get around this?



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.0 - 1996-09-24

  Features:
  - Added shell windows. Activated by the button to the right of the up-dir
    button at the top of the file list panes. This pops up a small built-in 
    shell that lets you run commands inside FileRunner. Like a simple xterm/
    shell session. The "current directory" of the left and right shell is 
    always synchronized with the "current directory" of the respective file 
    list panels. See the online guide for more on this.
  - Asynchronous file operations added. Instead of pressing the left mouse 
    button over the command buttons (like copy, delete etc...) you press the 
    right mouse button over the buttons and the command is executed 
    asynchronously (in the background).
    For some buttons, this is not implemented (where the operation is very fast 
    anyway, like doing soft links). This IS implemented for FTP,
    which means you can mark 25 files and press the right mouse button
    over the Copy button and have 25 parallell copyings going to the same
    server... Be careful with this!
    The drawback with asynchronous operations is that it won't tell you 
    if things go wrong during a copy, etc (for some operations, though
    it will print this to the standard error output for FileRunner). 
    It will also increase the risk that the file panels aren't showing 
    correct information (you'll have to use the Update button). For
    ftp transfers, it will usually take longer since it has to start
    another ftp session for every file it copies (in parallell).
  - New config opttion [config(view,extensions)] that holds general rules for
    which viewer to invoke on which file. For example *.jpg launches the 
    image viewer and *.avi launches the movie viewer. This is now fully
    user-configurable.
  - Abort button added. This tries to abort the current command. For normal
    file access commands (copy, move etc) it can only abort between two 
    files, not in the middle of operating on a file (in the middle of copying 
    a file). For FTP, you can abort in the middle of a transfer. The FTP 
    link will be closed when you do this, but reopened the next time you 
    access an FTP file.
  - In conjunction with the abort button, added the clone button. Only these
    two buttons may be pressed during execution of a command, like a long
    FTP transfer, for example. The clone operation is gone from the File menu.
  - Added back button (arrow left). Works just as the back button in 
    Netscape.
  - Added "Settings->Edit xxx color". Changes GUI colors on the fly.
  - Added "Settings->Edit xxx font". Changes GUI fonts on the fly.
  - New interface for User-defined buttons. See online guide.

  Small features:
  - Selection in file list panes now produce list of files when exported
    to other apps (or inside FileRunner).
  - Close button added to text viewer and text editor. (The little cross)
  - "normal" Save option added to text editor menu. Don't use "save", 
    then "quit" when editing config settings, use "save&quit" 
    instead... (Or the config won't be read back in)
  - File list panes now show selected / total entries.
  - Added geometry config options that let's you set the size and position 
    (in normal X11 syntax) for the main window, the text viewer window and 
    the Quick-editor window, respectively.
    [config(geometry,main), config(geometry,textviewer), 
    config(geometry,qedit)] 
  - Added "Settings->Set left start dir", "Setttings->Set right start dir"
    that saves your position in the file list panels for next time 
    you start. Quicker than editing the settings file by hand. You have 
    to save your settings to store it to the .fr file.
  - Added "Settings->Set window pos/size". Sets the config variable for
    the main window geometry [config(geometry,main)]. You have to save 
    your settings to store it to the .fr file.
  - Added command "Utilities->Check Size of selected..." that counts the
    size of selected files and directories and shows the result
    in kilobytes. Note that this uses the du -s command and you might
    have to add the -k flag here to get the answer in kilobytes on some
    platforms (like Solaris 2.x). Do that in the Settings->Edit Settings
    command [config(cmd,du)].
  - Added "Utilities->Swap Windows" that swaps the left and right directories
    shown.
  - Added a "little" keyboard support. If you set the config variable
    config(keyb_support) to 1, FileRunner activates keyboard support.
    Currently this is not very extensive. See online guide for more
    info on this.
    Config variable config(keyb_listb_support) has changed name to 
    config(keyb_support) and changed semantics to mean general 
    keyboard support on/off.
  - If you press the right mouse button in the directory entry, a requester
    pops up asking you to type a new path. This is sometimes faster than
    going to the directory entry and then clearing it, and then entering
    the new directory.
  - Changed the Update button to an iconized button. Due to lack of
    space. Sorry for this, it makes it harder to understand...

  Bugfixes:
  - Commands will now tell you if there are stuff they cannot do, like 
    doing a soft link from an FTP file. (Instead of just doing nothing)
  - Window is repainted correctly during long FTP transfers. This also makes
    the window react to the quit-window (delete) command sent to it from the
    window manager during transfers.
  - Bugfix: When history got longer than xx entries, it got truncated 
    to 0... Now only the oldest entries are deleted (as it should be)
  - Exiting FTP connections is now faster/more reliable.
  - FTP client now changes server socket for data connections on every command.
    Sometimes FTP servers had problems with using the same server socket
    every time, giving error codes 425 and 500 (?).
  - Bugfix: When deleting a directory displayed by FileRunner, it would
    crash. (Stupid bug, since it was designed to handle this...)
  - Bugfix: Sometimes FR would fail with "grab failed: another application 
    has grab" It looks like the grab fails for a reason I cannot determine. 
    It shouldn't fail. A workaround for this is that you now get a warning if 
    a grab fails. If you don't do anything stupid (like trying to start another
    command before the first one is finished) you should be OK. Anyone got an
    idea why this happens and how to handle it better?

1.2 - 1996-08-24
  - Default "unzip {%s}" command changed to "unzip -oqq {%s}"
    You have to change this in your .fr file if you already have a .fr file.
  - No more crashes when FileRunner tries to stat a file that disappeared 
    between getting the directory list and the actual stat'ing.
  - Viewing .gz files now works. (Just right-click on any gzipped text file)
  - RunCmd and C-Select button moved to Utilities menu. 
  - S-LnAs (Soft-Link As..) command button added.
  - Copying links: Copying a link to a file will copy the file, not the 
    link. Copying a link to a directory will copy the directory, not the 
    link. This is new behaviour.
  - Fixed Makefile.cc and ext.c so it will compile on Unixware and IRIX
  - Color for selection in listbox now configurable.  
    [config(gui,color_select)]
  - Fixed: Choosing a list of files, then pressing Edit or View(Image).
    (This is supposed to pass the whole list of files to the editor/image 
    viewer)
  - Added mod and midi extensions and mod and midi player commands.
    [config(cmd,play,sound,mod) and config(cmd,play,sound,midi)]
  - Added config option to allow listboxes to take focus when clicked. Gives
    some more control over keyboard access to the file list. Default off.
    [config(keyb_listb_support)]
  - Added config options to decide whether you want FileRunner to ask "Are
    you sure?" when deleting directories or files, respectively.
    [config(ask,dir_delete) and config(ask,file_delete)]
  - FTP transfers now show total average speed at the end of the transfer.
