Before you send me mail of something doesn't work please check this
list and see if there is something that matches your problem.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Q. Why is FileRunner complaining about dynamic linking not being
available on my system?

A. FileRunner uses the "load" command in tclsh to dynamically link in
the part of FileRunner that is written in C. This makes it unnecessary
to rebuild a whole new wish shell just to have a few extra
commands. (So it saves a lot of RAM and time). On some older Linux
platforms, the dynamic linking stuff is too old for this to work
correctly. It seems that you need to update /lib/ld.so and probably
also the /lib/libdl.so library. Note that the safest way of doing this
is to grab a whole new set of libraries from sunsite.unc.edu (under
the Linux/GCC directory) and install that. It looks like the Slackware
96 distribution has this problem and needs to be updated. When you've
got the new /lib/ld.so file and the rest of that stuff you need to
rebuild your Tcl/Tk stuff. (Or get a prebuilt binary, see next
question). When you rebuild it, the config script will tell you
whether or not dynamic linking will be available. If anyone has any
more info on this or might want to correct me, please send me an
email.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Q. Can I use beta versions of Tcl/Tk with FileRunner?

A. No. (Well you can, but it is a source of bugs I don't want to
handle).

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Q. I get this error when I start up. Why?

error while autoloading "load": bad option "join": should be atime,
dirname, executable, exists, extention, isdirectory, isfile , lstat,
mtime, owned, readable, readlink, root, size, stat, tail, type, or
writable

A. You have an old tcl/tk installation. Please get a new.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Q. I get this error when I start up FR on Linux. Why?

wish4.1: can't resolve symbol 'getgrgid'
wish4.1: can't resolve symbol 'statfs'

A. I'm guessing you need to rebuild your tcl/tk installation. Are you
running a really new libc?
